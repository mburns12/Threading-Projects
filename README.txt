These files are three projects that were completed in my Junior Year of college. They use Semaphors, Threading, and Sleeping to distribute work and actions evenly between actors. These actors all act and sleep in similar functions, but the Semaphors are the main focus here. Through different processes, we can make the threads interact differently, providing ovberall unique work distributions.
